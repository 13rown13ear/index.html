            Weapon and class skill trees have 5 different skills and one ultimate. Although these are where most of your skills will come from they are not the only options available. There are quests you can do to join various guilds within game. Leveling these skill trees will give you 5 more skills and 1 more ultimate per skill tree you level to <abbr title="these skill trees level differently than the weapon and class trees. which is why less levels are required">10</abbr>.

        <p2>
            Passives are <q>always on</q> style buffs you recieve from leveling up your skill trees. It is important to put skill points into your passives to increase the effectivness of your skills. Every skill tree has passives, some trees only have passives, like your racial tree. If you intend to use a skill from a tree it is recommended you level the passives as well to get the most from that skill.
