    <p>
        With crafting, you can collect different ingredients found throughout the world to craft items like: armor, weapons, jewlery, potions, food and enchantments. Food, enchanments, and potions are called consumables. Armor, weapons and jewlery are called equipment. All equipment and also food and enchanments are categorized by level and quality. Quality rankings from lowest to highest are: white, green, blue, purple, and gold. potions are categorized by level and buff offered.
    </p>
<ul>
    <li>Consumables</li>
        <p2>
            Consumables are buffs that can only be used once. Food and potions are single use items that buff temporarily, depending on your passives. Enchantments can be applied to armor, weapons, and jewlery. Once applied, you cant get the enchantment back, but you can apply another one over it, but this will replace the buff. Food grants you 1-2 hours of extra attributes and attribute recovery. Potions grant you instant attribute recovery as well as temporary recovery buffs. The cool down for potions is short so you can apply multiple per fight.

<h1>Crafting Summary</h1>
<p>
    Crafting of equipment and consumables can be circumvented by purchasing from crafters for in game currency, but trait research needs to be done by you. If you are not planning to craft, at least do your research. You will need it later on when your crafting levels up and you can get into the more advanced aspects of equipment.
