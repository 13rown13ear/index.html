    <p>
        Combat differs depending on role. You can organize the roles into two different categories: support and damage. Tank and healer are the support roles and have somewhat similar combat styles. Damage dealers are the damage, and their combat is different than support in that the <abbr title="Actions Per Minute">APM</abbr> is much higher and much more constant. Even tho the combat styles differ, they both require what is called a rotation. A rotation is the order in which you apply skills and preform light, medium or heavy damages. light, medium, and heavy damages cost nothing, and can be preformed by anyone, with any weapon, and are vital for adding free damage between skills, recovering magicka and stamina, and setting off your weapon enchantments.

            Supports have an interesting combat system. Many of their skills have longer timers and cost more attributes. So it is important to reapply skills immediatly after it expires, such as a taunt for a tank or a heal over time for a healer. the high cost of some of these skills insures that players wont just spam the input over and over, and forces the supports to keep a close eye on their skill timers. Potions and food help with attribute recovery, but for combat you will want to practice medium and heavy damages. These damages restore attributes they are a vital tool for any supports.

    <li>Damage</li>
        <p2>
            Damage combat requires a high APM To ensure damage and pressure stays constant, vetern damage dealers use a combat system called <q>light attack weaving.</q> This requires the damage dealer to light attack between the casting of every skill. Both light attacks and skills have a one second cooldown, so you cant speed through your rotation. With optimal skill application and proper light attack weaving, damage dealers can insure that the pressure remains constant and everything dies in and orderly fashion. If your stamina or magicka gets low you can switch light attacks to medium attacks to help maintain those attributes.

<h1>Combat Summary</h1>
        <p2>
            Though the combat styles differ slightly, the idea of rotation and light or heavy attack weaving is a constant for both. Food and potion buffs make it easier to keep a high APM for both styles of combat.
