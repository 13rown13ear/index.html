<h1>Class List</h1>

    <p>
        Here is a list of the various classes available in the game and a brief description taken from the official eso website
    </p>

<ul>
    <li>Dragonknight</li>
        <p>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/classes">
                Burn your foes in cleansing flame and withstand almost any assault with the Dragonknight, a fiery, unrelenting class that thrives in the heart of battle. The Dragonknight class allows you to win the war of attrition with abilities that draw power from both the earth and the beasts of myth while overpowering your foes with ferocious fire spells.

    <li>Sorcerer</li>
        <p>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/classes">
                The horrors of Oblivion and the power of lightning itself are yours to command with the Sorcerer Class. As a Sorcerer, unlimited power is at your fingertips, allowing you to call powerful lightning strikes from above, support your allies, suppress your enemies, or overwhelm your foes with Daedric monsters.
            </blockquote>
        </p>
    <li>Nightblade</li>
        <p>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/classes">
                Attack from the shadows, drain your foes' health, and vanish into the void with the Nightblade Class. The shadows truly are your greatest weapon as you wield abilities that deal devastating damage at any range and siphon your victim's lifeforce to your allies.
            </blockquote>
        </p>
    <li>Templar</li>
        <p>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/classes">
                Seeking darkness whether it might be found, the Templar is a beacon to their allies and a blinding threat to their foes. As a Templar, you must bring justice to Tamriel in the form of cleansing light. Call forth the limitless power of the sun to obliterate your enemies and restore yourself and your allies in radiant light.

    <li>Necromancer (available in crown store or with current chapter collection purchase)</li>
        <p>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/classes">
                All of Tamrielâ€™s dead are a resource for you to manipulate and exploit, as nothing is forbidden for those who seek to master the dark arts. The Necromancer Class brings a unique style of play to The Elder Scrolls Online, allowing you to summon the undead and make use of corpses to overwhelm your enemies and empower your attacks.
            </blockquote>
        </p>
    <li>Warden (available in crown store or with current chapter collection purchase)</li>
        <p>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/classes">
                Manipulate the wilds and summon powerful beasts with the Warden, a versatile Class that draws from the power of nature itself. When playing a Warden character, you can unleash the fury of the wilds upon unsuspecting intruders, wrap your allies in the healing power of the Green, and encase yourself in impenetrable, protective frost.
            </blockquote>
        </p>
    <li>Arcanist (available with purchase of current chapter upgrade or collection)</li>
        <p>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/classes">
                Master forbidden knowledge and manipulate arcane energies, ancient runes, and lost tomes as the Arcanist. Draw power not intended for mortal use and weave destructive, restorative, or defensive magics that are further empowered by the unique Crux system.

<h1>Class Summary</h1>

<p>
    When it comes to choosing a class you cant really go wrong. Unlike some other MMO's, classes dont lock you into a specific role, so when selecting a class dont be afraid to try out different ones to see which visuals you enjoy more. There is <strong>some</strong> importance when selecting class in relation to role, but for the most part any class can do any role (its just some classes do roles better than others.)
