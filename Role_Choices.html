    <p>
        With this game you have three choices to make with your role. You can either be a tank, a healer, or a damage dealer. Here we will break down the tasks required of each to successfully complete group content, and which resource attribute would be most beneficial to which role.
    </p>

<ul>

    <li>Tank</li>

        <p2>
            Tanks are in the group to control the situation, debuff the enemies, and survive the damage. Damage output is not important at all. A good tank keeps the room under their full control at all times. You will need to know which enemies to pull, where to plant the enemies in the room, <abbr title="as small as this tip seems, it is one of the most important">and when to stay still</abbr>. For your attributes, you will want to put all points into health to begin with. This will give you a good safety net as you learn your tank. When you get to know your playstyle you can change the attribute point layout later depending on your stamina and magicka needs.
        </p2>

    <li>Healer</li>
        
        <p2>
            Healers are in the group to keep the tank and damage dealers alive, and to buff the group to increase damage output and survivability. Damage output is useful in <abbr title="a secondary focus once you know the group is staying alive and buffed">4 person content</abbr>, but with 12 person content you will want pull back any damage and focus soley on healing and buffing. For attributes you will want to put all points into magicka.
        </p2>

    <li>Damage Dealer</li>
        
        <p2>
            Damage dealers are in the group to insure everything in the room dies in a quick and clean fashion. You may have a self heal to ease pressure on your healer in difficult content, but your main focus is your damage output. It is extremely important that your <abbr title ="Damage Dealer's">dd's</abbr> trust their supports to keep them alive. It is also important for damage dealers to maintain situational awareness while damaging enemies. For your attributes you will put all points into either your stamina resource or your magicka resource. This will depend if you have made a magicka or stamina dd.
        </p2>
</ul>

<h1>Role Summary</h1>
    
    <p>
        Each role carries importance when it comes to completing group content. When first starting i know the urge to create <q>one character to rule them all</q>, is strong, but when in a group it is important that you pick a role and put everything into that role, so that you can succeed together as a group.
